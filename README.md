### Prerequisites

#### Interfaces
Create your own web application based on an external API. The web app must contain:
- First, you need to find an API so you can base the development of the webapp around it. The API should allow you to:
  - Get a list of items with a unique item id (or generate the unique id).
  - For a given item, get detailed information about it.
- Follow the layout of the wireframes provided. You should personalize the rest of the design including colors, typographies, spacings, etc.
- You should build these interfaces:
  - The home page.
    - When the page loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
    - The selected API and shows the list of items on screen.
    - The Involvement API to show the item likes.
    -  Remember that your page should make only 2 requests:
    -  One to the base API.
    -  And one to the Involvement API.
    -  When the user clicks on the Like button of an item, the interaction is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.
    -  When the user clicks on the "Comments" button, the Comments popup appears.
    -  When the user clicks on the "Reservations" button, the Reservations popup appears (only for the groups of 3 students).
    -  Home page header and navigation similar to the given mockup.
    -  Home page footer similar to the given mockup.
  - The comments popup.
    -  When the popup loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
      -  The selected API and shows details about the selected item.
      -  The Involvement API to show the item comments.
      -  When the user clicks on the "Comment" button, the data is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.
- We have counters in all the interfaces that show:
  - The number of items (home).
  - The number of comments (comments popup).

#### Technical set up
 - Set up the repository on GitHub and use Gitflow.
 - Set up webpack.
 - Set up a JavaScript testing library (Jest).
